Ghibli Characters: A Magical Data Exploration with SQL
✨ Overview
Studio Ghibli’s animated films have left an indelible mark on our hearts with their magical settings, rich storytelling, and unforgettable characters. Inspired by the studio’s fantasy worlds, this project dives into the fascinating universe of Ghibli through data. Using SQL as the primary tool, we explore the characteristics and quirks of various Ghibli characters in a data-driven journey.

SELECT, DISTINCT, and filtering clauses

Aggregate functions like AVG() and COUNT()

JOIN operations and subqueries

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Window functions such as RANK() and ROW_NUMBER()

Conditional logic via CASE WHEN

Array handling with UNNEST() and string_to_array()

These tools helped uncover patterns and relationships among characters.
